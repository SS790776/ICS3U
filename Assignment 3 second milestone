Variable dictionary:
    t - turtle.turtle(), makes for coding lines and using the turtle object functions a lot
        easier.
    file - a string that holds the name of the xpm file the code needs to use in order to
        plot the dots.
    fh - open(file, "r"), makes for opening files a lot easier,
        instead of needing to code out the whole function I could just use fh.readline().
    line - a string that holds the current line being read, will extract information from
        this variable.
    firstinf - an array that holds the information from the first line of the file.
        This includes the x and y dimensions, and the total number of colours.
    xdim - a variable split from firstinf that contains the x/horizontal dimension
        of the xpm file that needs to be drawn.
    ydim - a variable split from firstinf that contains the y/vertical dimension
        of the xpm file that needs to be drawn.
    colournum - a variable split from firstinf, holds the total number of colours
        needed to draw the picture.
    colour - a dictionary that holds the colours and their corresponding symbol.
    symb - a temporary variable split from line that holds the corresponding symbol
        of a colour.
    c - a variable needed for unpacking and splitting colour definitions.
    rainbow - a temporary variable split from line that holds the colour corresponding
        to a symbol.
    image - an array that holds all of the characters/symbols of the image,
        each index being a seperate line.
    err - a variable that holds the error message for OSError
    err2 - a variable that holds the error message for EOFError
    u - an integer that is either 1 or 0, a condition for a while loop.
    o - an integer that is either 1 or 0, a condition for a while loop.
    p - an integer that is either 1 or 0, a condition for a while loop.
    ld - a string that holds the user input for background customisation.
        L for light grey, D for dark grey, and W for white.
    space - an integer that holds the desired spacing of the dots when drawing.
    size - an integer that holds the desired size of the dots when drawing.
    rotation - an integer that holds the desired rotation in degrees when drawing.
    counter - an integer that keeps count of the amount of lines drawn. Is used
        for calculations when drawing.
    position - a variable that holds the turtle's calculated starting position
        when drawing.
    pointc - a temporary variable that holds the corresponding colour of a symbol
        when drawing.
